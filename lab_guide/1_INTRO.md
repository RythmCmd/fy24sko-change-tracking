# Introduction

The purpose of this self-paced lab is to create a simulation application that students can use in order to test various methods of creating [New Relic Change Tracking markers](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction/).

## Goals

 * Add a Change Tracking marker to your application using a GitHub Action
 * Add a Change Tracking marker to your application using the NerdGraph API
 * Add a Change Tracking marker to your application using the New Relic CLI

## Pre-requisites

To successfully complete this lab, you will need:
 1. A New Relic account where you will collect your license key, user API key, and ultimately the entity GUID for an application you create.
 2. A personal GitHub account where you can fork this repository.
 3. Access to install the [New Relic CLI](https://developer.newrelic.com/automate-workflows/get-started-new-relic-cli/) on your computer.

## Next steps

Continue to setting up your environment and creating your first Change Tracking marker using [GitHub Actions](./2_GITHUB%20ACTION.md).
